# Type Type

Type Type is a typing speed game where players type out words as they appear on the screen. The game measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) and challenges players to improve their accuracy and speed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML file that provides the structure of the game.
- `styles.css` – The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the game.
- `typing.js` – The JavaScript file that contains the logic and functionality of the game.

## Features

- Typing challenge with randomly generated words.
- Real-time feedback on typing accuracy.
- Display of Words Per Minute (WPM) score at the end of the game.
- Simple and clean design with a focus on usability.
